# Project Status
This project is currently in development. For now you can only register as a new user, then the application sends you an URL link that you have to visit to activate your account. Then you can log in to you account and visit the Feeds page. The login and registration form have some validations, such as the 'Password' and the 'Confirm Password' fields have to match, the email has to be valid and so on.
